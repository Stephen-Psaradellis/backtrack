## Market Positioning

### Positioning Statement

"For singles who prefer organic connections, Backtrack is the location-based app that helps you find people you've actually noticed at real places - without requiring photos, tracking your location, or matching you with strangers."

### Positioning Map

```
                    SPECIFIC (Known Person)
                           ^
                           |
           Backtrack ------+
                           |
PASSIVE -------------------|------------------ ACTIVE
(Algorithm)                |               (User-Driven)
                           |
        Happn ---+---------+
                 |
    Tinder ------+
    Bumble       |
    Hinge        |
                 v
                    RANDOM (Strangers)
```

Backtrack occupies the "Active + Specific" quadrant - users actively describe specific people they've noticed, rather than passively letting an algorithm show them random strangers.
