#comingsoon #missedconnections #dating
```

**Day 3 - Twitter Thread**
```
1/ A thread about missed connections:

That person at the coffee shop you've seen every Tuesday for 6 months.

The bookstore browser who made you forget what section you were in.

They exist. You noticed them. Then... nothing.

Until now.

```

### Week -2 (How It Works)

**Day 1 - TikTok (30-45 sec)**
```
[Screen recording style with upbeat music]

"How Backtrack works in 30 seconds:

1. You see someone at a coffee shop
2. Open Backtrack, find that location
3. Build an avatar describing them [show avatar builder]
4. Write a quick note
5. They browse that location later
6. They recognize your description
7. You match and chat anonymously

No photos. No profiles. Just real missed connections.

Link in bio."
```

**Day 3 - Instagram Carousel (5 slides)**
```
Slide 1: "How Backtrack Works"
Slide 2: "1. Notice someone interesting at a real location"
Slide 3: "2. Describe them with our avatar builder (no photos needed)"
Slide 4: "3. They find your post when they browse that location"
Slide 5: "4. Match and chat anonymously. Your second chance."

Caption: "It's not another dating app. It's your second chance at connections that already happened."
```

**Day 5 - Twitter**
```
The difference:

Dating apps: "Here are 50 strangers within 10 miles"

Backtrack: "Here's the person YOU noticed at Starbucks last Tuesday"

One is random. One is real.
```

```

---

## Crisis/Response Templates

### Negative Feedback
```
"This app is creepy"
Reply: "We understand the concern! Privacy is our #1 priority. No photos required, no location tracking, anonymous until you're ready. We built Backtrack because existing options felt invasive."
```

### Safety Questions
```
"How do you prevent stalking?"
Reply: "Great question. We have 18+ verification, image moderation, easy blocking/reporting, and we never share locations. Users only see posts at locations they actively browse - no one can find out where you've been."
```
