## Alternative Screenshot Approaches

### Approach A: Clean App Screens

- Pure app UI with minimal overlay text
- Let the design speak for itself
- Works well for premium, design-forward apps

### Approach B: Lifestyle + App

- Real-world photos (coffee shop, gym) in background
- App screen overlaid
- More emotional, story-driven

### Approach C: Feature Callouts

- App screen with arrows/highlights
- Point to specific features
- More educational, good for complex features

### Approach D: Before/After

- Side-by-side comparison
- "Before Backtrack" / "After Backtrack"
- Good for value proposition

**Recommendation:** Combine approaches. Use Approach B for hero, Approach A for most screens, Approach C for complex features.
