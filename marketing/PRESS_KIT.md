## Elevator Pitch

**One Sentence**:
Backtrack is a location-based app that helps you reconnect with people you noticed at real places but never got to meet.

**30-Second Pitch**:
Every day, we notice interesting people at coffee shops, gyms, bookstores, and events - but rarely get the chance to connect. Backtrack changes that. Create an anonymous post describing someone you noticed using our avatar builder, and if they're on the app, they might find your message. It's missed connections reimagined for the mobile age - private, location-based, and avatar-powered.

**Two-Minute Story**:
Dating apps have a fundamental problem: they show you strangers. But the most meaningful connections often start with a moment of recognition - a glance across a coffee shop, a shared smile at a bookstore, eye contact at the gym.

Backtrack captures those moments. When you notice someone interesting at a location, you create a post describing them using customizable avatars - no photos required. You write a short note about what caught your attention. You take a selfie to verify you were there.

Later, when that person browses posts at that location, they might recognize your description of them. If they do, you can start an anonymous conversation. No personal information is shared until both people are comfortable.

It's not about algorithms matching profiles. It's about rediscovering the human connections that already happened - but didn't go anywhere.

## The Problem We Solve

### The Missed Connection Phenomenon

- **73% of people** have experienced noticing someone attractive in public but not approaching them (YouGov, 2023)
- **85% of singles** say they'd prefer to meet someone organically rather than through an app (Pew Research, 2023)
- **Craigslist's "Missed Connections"** section processed millions of posts before being discontinued

### Why Current Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Dating apps | Match with strangers, not people you've actually noticed |
| Social media | Requires knowing their name or handle |
| Approaching directly | Socially intimidating, often inappropriate |
| Doing nothing | The connection is lost forever |

### The Backtrack Solution

We bridge the gap between noticing someone and meeting them - without the awkwardness of a cold approach or the randomness of dating apps.

## How It Works

### For Post Creators ("Producers")

```
1. NOTICE     You see someone interesting at a location
       ↓
2. CREATE     Describe them using our avatar builder (11+ attributes)
       ↓
3. WRITE      Add a note about the moment
       ↓
4. VERIFY     Take a selfie to prove you were there
       ↓
5. POST       Your anonymous post appears at that location
```

### For Post Browsers ("Consumers")

```
1. BROWSE     View posts at locations you frequent
       ↓
2. RECOGNIZE  See if any avatar descriptions match you
       ↓
3. MATCH      If you recognize yourself, respond to the post
       ↓
4. CHAT       Start an anonymous conversation
       ↓
5. CONNECT    Reveal identities when you're both ready
```

## FAQs for Press

### Is Backtrack a dating app?

Backtrack is a social connection app. While many users may have romantic intentions, the app can be used for any type of missed connection - friendships, professional networking, or simply saying "I noticed you too."

### How is privacy protected?

Privacy is foundational. Users describe others with avatars, not photos. Messages are anonymous until users choose to share more. Location is never tracked - users choose where to post. All data can be deleted on request.

### What prevents misuse?

We require 18+ age verification, moderate all shared images with AI, have robust blocking and reporting features, and enforce community guidelines. Users who violate terms are permanently banned.

### How does avatar matching work?

Our algorithm compares 11+ avatar attributes across two tiers. Primary attributes (skin tone, hair color, style) carry more weight than secondary attributes (eye type, clothing). Users can set their own matching thresholds.

### Is the app free?

Yes, Backtrack is free to use. We may introduce premium features in the future, but core functionality will remain free.
