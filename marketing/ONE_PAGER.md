# Backtrack - One-Pager

## Find who you noticed. Connect where it happened.

## The Problem

Every day, millions of people notice someone interesting at coffee shops, gyms, bookstores, and public spaces - but never get the chance to connect. These "missed connections" represent real moments of mutual interest that go nowhere.

- **73%** of people have noticed someone attractive in public but didn't approach
- **85%** of singles prefer meeting organically over dating apps
- Dating apps show you strangers; they can't help with people you've actually noticed

## The Solution: Backtrack

**Backtrack is a location-based app that helps you reconnect with people you've noticed at real places.**

### How It Works

```
Notice Someone → Describe with Avatar → Post at Location → They Find You → Match & Chat
```

1. You see someone interesting at a real location
2. Describe them using our avatar builder (no photos needed)
3. Post anonymously at that venue
4. They browse posts and recognize your description
5. Match and chat anonymously until you're ready to reveal more

# Elevator Pitches

## 10-Second Pitch
"Backtrack helps you find people you've noticed at coffee shops, gyms, and bookstores - but never got to meet. Describe them with avatars, post anonymously, and connect when they find you."

## 30-Second Pitch
"Ever notice someone at a coffee shop but never say hello? Backtrack is your second chance. Create an anonymous post describing them with our avatar builder - no photos needed. When they browse that location's posts, they might recognize themselves. If they do, you can chat anonymously. It's missed connections reimagined for the mobile age."

## 60-Second Pitch
"Dating apps have a problem: they show you strangers. But the most interesting connections happen in real life - a glance at a coffee shop, a moment at the gym, eye contact at a bookstore. These connections are real, but they rarely go anywhere.

Backtrack changes that. When you notice someone, describe them using our avatar builder - hair color, style, glasses, clothing. Post anonymously at that location. Later, when they browse posts there, they might recognize your description of them.

If they do, you match and chat - completely anonymous until you're both ready to share more. No photos required. No personal info exposed. Just a way to reconnect with people you've already noticed.

We've built a privacy-first platform with real-time chat, smart avatar matching, and comprehensive safety features. Download Backtrack and find your missed connection."
