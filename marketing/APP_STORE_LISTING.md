Ever notice someone interesting but miss the chance to connect? Backtrack lets you find them again. Anonymous, location-based, avatar-powered matchmaking.

### Full Description (4000 chars max)

**Find who you noticed. Connect where it happened.**

Have you ever locked eyes with someone at a coffee shop, shared a moment at a bookstore, or noticed someone interesting at the gym - but never got the chance to say hello? Backtrack is your second chance.

**How It Works**

1. **Notice Someone** - You see someone interesting at a real location
2. **Create a Post** - Describe them using our customizable avatar builder
3. **They Find You** - When they browse that location's posts, they might recognize themselves
4. **Connect Anonymously** - Start chatting without revealing your identity until you're ready

**Privacy-First Design**

- No real photos required - use avatars to describe appearances
- Anonymous until you decide to reveal yourself
- No personal data shared with other users
- Complete control over your information

**Key Features**

- **Location Discovery** - Find venues using Google Maps integration
- **Avatar Matching** - Our smart algorithm matches avatars to help you find the right person
- **Real-Time Chat** - Instant messaging when you match
- **Selfie Verification** - Prove you were actually there
- **Complete Privacy** - Block, report, and control who sees you
- **Photo Sharing** - Share photos in chat when you're ready

**Perfect For**

- That person at the coffee shop you've seen every Tuesday
- The fellow gym-goer with the great energy
- The bookstore browser who caught your eye
- Anyone you noticed but didn't get to meet

**Safety First**

- 18+ only - age verification required
- Content moderation on all shared images
- Easy blocking and reporting
- No location tracking - you choose where to post

Download Backtrack and find your missed connection.
