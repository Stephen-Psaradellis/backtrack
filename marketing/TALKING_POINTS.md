## Key Talking Points by Audience

### For General Users

**Why Backtrack exists:**
"Every day, we notice interesting people at coffee shops, gyms, and bookstores - but rarely get to connect. Backtrack gives those moments a second chance."

**How it's different:**
"Dating apps show you strangers. Backtrack helps you find people you've already noticed in real life. It's about rediscovering connections, not creating random ones."

**Privacy focus:**
"You don't need to share photos to use Backtrack. Describe people with avatars, chat anonymously, and only share what you want, when you want."

### For Press/Media

**The problem we solve:**
"There's a gap between noticing someone and meeting them. Approaching strangers is socially complex, and dating apps can't help with specific people you've seen. Backtrack bridges that gap."

**The market opportunity:**
"73% of people have noticed someone attractive but didn't approach. 85% of singles prefer organic meetings. We're serving an underserved but universal need."

**Our approach:**
"We've built a privacy-first platform that uses avatar descriptions instead of photos, ties posts to real locations, and keeps everything anonymous until users are ready."

### For Investors

**Market size:**
"The dating app market is $9B+, but 85% of singles still prefer organic connections. We're targeting the gap between real-world attraction and app-based meeting."

**Differentiation:**
"We're not another dating app. We're the only platform focused specifically on missed connections - people you've actually noticed, at real places."

**Traction potential:**
"Location-based + organic connections = network effects. As more users join in an area, the value increases for everyone."

### For Partners (Venues)

**Value proposition:**
"Backtrack turns your venue into a place where connections happen. Being featured as a popular Backtrack location increases foot traffic and customer loyalty."

**Implementation:**
"Simple integration: display signage, get featured in-app, optional event integrations."

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Product Questions

**Q: How is Backtrack different from Tinder/Bumble?**
A: Dating apps show you random people within a radius. Backtrack shows you posts about people at specific locations you visit. It's not about meeting strangers - it's about finding people you've actually noticed.

**Q: Do I need to share photos?**
A: No. You describe people using our avatar builder instead of photos. This protects everyone's privacy. The only optional photo is a selfie to verify you were at a location - and that's never shown to other users.

**Q: How does matching work?**
A: When someone creates a post describing a person they saw, others can browse posts at that location. Our matching algorithm highlights posts that closely match your avatar. If you recognize yourself in a description, you can respond and start chatting.

**Q: What if someone makes a post about me without my consent?**
A: Posts are anonymous descriptions using avatars, not actual photos. No real identifying information is shared. If you find content concerning, you can report it for review. We have robust moderation and take all reports seriously.

**Q: Is the app really free?**
A: Yes, core functionality is free. We may introduce optional premium features in the future, but finding and connecting with missed connections will always be free.

### Privacy Questions

**Q: Do you track my location?**
A: No. We never track where you are. You actively choose which locations to browse and post at. We use Google Maps to find venues, but your actual location is never stored or shared.

**Q: Who can see my posts?**
A: Anyone browsing posts at that location can see the post (not your identity). The avatar you create to describe someone, your note, and the verification status are visible. Your identity is never revealed until you choose to share in chat.

**Q: Can I delete my account and data?**
A: Yes, one tap in settings. We delete all your data within 30 days as required by GDPR. This includes posts, messages, photos, and profile information.

**Q: Is my chat encrypted?**
A: Yes, all data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest. Chats are private between matched users.

### Safety Questions

**Q: What prevents stalking or harassment?**
A: Several layers of protection:
- Posts use avatar descriptions, not photos
- No location tracking
- Anonymous chat until you choose otherwise
- Easy one-tap blocking and reporting
- AI-powered image moderation
- 18+ age verification
- Active community moderation team

**Q: How do you verify age?**
A: Users must confirm they are 18+ during signup and accept our terms which require accurate age information. We reserve the right to request additional verification and ban users who violate age requirements.

**Q: What happens when I report someone?**
A: Reports are reviewed by our moderation team. Depending on severity, actions range from warnings to permanent bans. We take all reports seriously and respond within 24 hours for urgent matters.

**Q: Can someone find out where I've been?**
A: No. Backtrack does not track or store your location history. Others can only see posts you've created (at locations you chose to post at), not where you've browsed.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What platforms is Backtrack available on?**
A: iOS (13+) and Android (8+). A web version is in development.

**Q: Does the app work offline?**
A: Basic browsing of cached content works offline, but creating posts, matching, and chatting require an internet connection.

**Q: How do notifications work?**
A: You can enable push notifications for matches and messages. These are customizable in settings - turn on what matters, turn off what doesn't.

## Objection Handling

### "This sounds creepy"

**Response:**
"We understand the initial reaction. That's exactly why we built Backtrack with privacy as the foundation. No photos are required - you describe people with avatars. Chat is anonymous. Location is never tracked. You control what you share and when. It's actually more private than traditional dating apps where your real photos are shown to strangers."

### "How is this different from Craigslist Missed Connections?"

**Response:**
"Craigslist was text-only, had no matching, and was famous for spam and fake posts. Backtrack uses visual avatar descriptions for better matching, ties posts to verified locations, offers selfie verification for authenticity, has real-time chat, and includes comprehensive moderation. It's missed connections reimagined for the mobile age."

### "What if someone makes fake posts?"

**Response:**
"We have multiple layers of protection: selfie verification (optional but encouraged) proves you were at the location, our matching algorithm helps identify genuine posts, users can report fake content, and our moderation team reviews reports. Repeat offenders are banned."

### "Isn't this just for dating?"

**Response:**
"Backtrack is for any kind of missed connection. Many users have romantic intentions, but others use it to find potential friends, professional connections, or simply to tell someone 'I noticed you too.' The app is designed for authentic human connections of all kinds."

### "What if the person I'm looking for isn't on the app?"

**Response:**
"That's the challenge of any network-based product. As more people join, the likelihood of finding your missed connection increases. In the meantime, creating a post lets you try - and you might be surprised. Plus, your post will be there if they ever do join."

## Sound Bites

### Short (Tweet-length)

- "Dating apps show you strangers. Backtrack helps you find people you've actually noticed."
- "Your missed connection might already be waiting."
- "Not an algorithm. A real moment you remember."
- "Find who you noticed. Connect where it happened."
- "The app for connections that already happened."

### Medium (Instagram caption length)

"Every day, we notice people. At coffee shops. In bookstores. At the gym. Sometimes we make eye contact. Sometimes we smile. But almost never do we connect. Backtrack changes that. Describe who you saw with avatars, post at that location, and see if they find you. No photos required. Anonymous until you're ready. Your second chance at a real connection."

### Long (Press release style)

"Backtrack is a location-based mobile application that enables users to reconnect with people they've noticed at real-world locations. Unlike traditional dating apps that match users with strangers based on algorithms, Backtrack focuses on 'missed connections' - moments of genuine interest that occurred in physical spaces. Users describe the person they noticed using customizable avatars, eliminating the need to share actual photos and protecting everyone's privacy. Posts are tied to specific venues, and if the described person browses that location, they may recognize themselves and initiate an anonymous conversation. With robust privacy protections, real-time messaging, and comprehensive safety features, Backtrack represents a new approach to social connection - one based on real moments rather than random matching."
