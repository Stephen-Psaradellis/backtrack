## Full Description (4000 chars max)

**Find who you noticed. Connect where it happened.**

Ever locked eyes with someone at a coffee shop but didn't get the chance to say hello? Noticed someone at the gym or bookstore who caught your attention? Backtrack gives you a second chance to connect.

HOW BACKTRACK WORKS

Step 1: Notice Someone
You see someone interesting at a real location - a cafe, bar, gym, bookstore, anywhere.

Step 2: Create an Anonymous Post
Use our avatar builder to describe what they looked like. Write a note about the moment. Take a selfie to verify you were there.

Step 3: They Find Your Post
When they browse posts at that location, your avatar description might catch their eye.

Step 4: Match & Chat
If they recognize themselves, you can start an anonymous conversation. No identities revealed until you're both ready.

PRIVACY-FIRST FEATURES

No Real Photos Required
Describe people using customizable avatars instead of actual photos. Your identity stays private until you choose to reveal it.

Anonymous Messaging
Chat without sharing personal information. You control when (and if) you share more.

Location-Based, Not Location-Tracked
We don't track your location. You choose which venues to post at and browse.

Safe & Moderated
All images are moderated. Easy blocking and reporting. 18+ only with age verification.

WHY BACKTRACK?

Dating apps show you strangers. Backtrack connects you with people you've actually noticed in real life - those moments of mutual interest that happen every day but rarely lead anywhere.

It's not about algorithms matching you with profiles. It's about rediscovering real connections that already happened.

Download Backtrack. Find your missed connection.
