## 2. Full Feature Walkthrough (2-3 minutes)

### Purpose

### Script

**[0:00-0:15] INTRO**
```
[Screen: Backtrack logo]

"Hey, welcome to Backtrack - the app that helps you find people
you've noticed at real locations but never got to meet.

In the next few minutes, I'll show you exactly how it works."
```

**[0:15-0:40] THE PROBLEM**
```
[Screen: B-roll of coffee shop, gym, bookstore]

"We've all been there. You're at your regular coffee shop,
you notice someone interesting, maybe you make eye contact...

But then? Nothing happens. They leave, you leave, and that
moment of connection is lost forever.

Dating apps can't help - they show you strangers.
But Backtrack is different."
```

**[0:40-1:10] SIGNING UP**
```
[Screen: App - signup flow]

"Getting started is simple. Download Backtrack, sign up with
your email, and accept our terms. We require age verification
because this is an 18+ app.

Next, create your avatar. This represents YOU - it's how
others will see if a post might be about them. Pick your
features: hair, skin tone, style, glasses, clothing...

Don't worry, you can update this anytime."
```

**[1:10-1:45] CREATING A POST**
```
[Screen: App - post creation flow]

"Now let's say you noticed someone at Starbucks this morning.
Tap 'Create Post' and search for the location.

Found it? Great. Now describe who you saw using the avatar
builder. Hair color, style, were they wearing glasses?
What kind of clothes?

Write a short note - something like 'You were reading by the
window, great book choice. Would love to chat sometime.'

Optionally, take a quick selfie. This proves you were there
but it's never shown to anyone else.

Review and post. That's it - you've created a missed connection."
```

**[1:45-2:15] FINDING POSTS**
```
[Screen: App - browsing flow]

"Now let's flip to the other side. You're browsing Backtrack
at locations you visit regularly.

Tap on a venue - say, your gym. You'll see posts from people
who noticed someone there.

Each post shows an avatar description and a note. Our matching
algorithm highlights posts that closely match YOUR avatar.
Higher match scores mean this post might be about you.

See one that sounds like it could be you? Tap to respond."
```

**[2:15-2:40] MATCHING & CHATTING**
```
[Screen: App - chat flow]

"When you respond to a post - or someone responds to yours -
you're matched and can start chatting.

Messages are delivered instantly. You'll see read receipts,
typing indicators, the works.

Everything is anonymous at first. Share what you're comfortable
with, when you're comfortable. You can share photos in the chat
when you're ready.

Block or report anytime if something feels off."
```

**[2:40-3:00] CLOSING**
```
[Screen: App home + download CTA]

"That's Backtrack. Real locations. Real connections. Anonymous
until you're ready.

Download free on iOS and Android. Your missed connection might
already be waiting.

Thanks for watching - and good luck finding who you noticed."
```

describing yourself."
```

**[0:15-0:30] CREATING A POST**
```
[Screen: Post creation fast-forward]
"Noticed someone? Tap Create. Pick the location. Build an
avatar describing them. Write a quick note. Take a selfie to
verify. Post it."
```

**[0:30-0:45] BROWSING & MATCHING**
```
[Screen: Browsing and matching]

bookstores - anywhere you've had a missed connection."

[0:20-0:30]
"We never track your location. You choose where to browse
and where to post."
```

### 4c. Privacy Features Demo (45 seconds)

```
[0:00-0:10]

[0:10-0:20]
"All chat is anonymous. No real names, no personal info
shared until you choose."

[0:20-0:30]
"We don't track your location. Posts are tied to venues,
but we never know where you actually are."

[0:30-0:40]
"Block anyone with one tap. Report violations easily.
Delete your account and all data anytime."
