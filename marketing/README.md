## Brand Essentials

### Tagline
**"Find who you noticed"**

### Core Value Proposition
Backtrack helps you reconnect with people you've noticed at real locations but never got to meet - privately and anonymously.

### Key Messages

1. **Not strangers, real connections** - Unlike dating apps that show you random people, Backtrack helps you find people you've actually noticed in real life.

2. **Privacy-first** - No photos required, anonymous chat, no location tracking. You control what you share and when.

3. **Real locations, real moments** - Tied to actual venues where connections happen - coffee shops, gyms, bookstores, events.

4. **Your second chance** - Every missed connection now has the potential to become something more.
