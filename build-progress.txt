Project: Love Ledger - Enable Development Mode Without API Keys
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2024-12-23

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a new feature that adds dev-time convenience by implementing mock services.
           It requires creating new files (lib/dev/*), modifying initialization logic in existing
           Supabase clients, and establishing patterns for mock service injection - all without
           changing production behavior.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 5
- Total subtasks: 13
- Created init.sh
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json

Phase Summary:
1. Development Mode Utilities: 3 subtasks, depends on []
   - Create dev mode detection utility
   - Create mock Supabase client
   - Create mock Google Maps provider

2. Supabase Client Integration: 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-1]
   - Update lib/supabase/client.ts
   - Update lib/supabase/server.ts
   - Update lib/supabase/middleware.ts
   - Update lib/supabase.ts (React Native)

3. Dev Mode UI Indicator: 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-1]
   - Create DevModeBanner component
   - Integrate into app layout

4. Unit Tests for Dev Mode: 2 subtasks, depends on [phase-2]
   - Create tests for dev mode detection
   - Create tests for mock Supabase client

5. Integration Verification: 4 subtasks, depends on [phase-2, phase-3, phase-4]
   - Verify app starts without .env.local
   - Verify avatar builder demo works
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify production build behavior

Services Involved:
- main: Next.js frontend with Supabase and Google Maps integrations

Key Files to Create:
- lib/dev/index.ts (dev mode detection utilities)
- lib/dev/mock-supabase.ts (mock Supabase client)
- lib/dev/mock-google-maps.ts (mock Maps provider)
- components/DevModeBanner.tsx (visual indicator)

Key Files to Modify:
- lib/supabase/client.ts (add conditional mock)
- lib/supabase/server.ts (add conditional mock)
- lib/supabase/middleware.ts (skip auth in dev mode)
- lib/supabase.ts (React Native client)
- app/layout.tsx (add dev banner)

Pattern Reference:
- __tests__/mocks/supabase.ts (comprehensive mock patterns to adapt)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: [phase-2, phase-3] can run together after phase-1
- Speedup estimate: 1.3x faster with 2 workers

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===
